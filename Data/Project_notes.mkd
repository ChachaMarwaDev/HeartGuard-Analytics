# Analysis Questions for Heart Disease Dataset

## 1. Descriptive Statistics
- What is the distribution of age across the dataset? Are certain age groups more represented?
- What is the male-to-female ratio, and does heart disease prevalence differ by sex?
- What are the mean, median, and standard deviation for continuous variables (trestbps, chol, thalach, oldpeak)?

## 2. Target Variable Analysis
- What percentage of patients have heart disease (target = 1) vs. normal (target = 0)?
- Is the dataset balanced or imbalanced?

## 3. Demographic Relationships
- How does heart disease prevalence vary by age group (e.g., <40, 40-50, 50-60, >60)?
- Is there a significant difference in heart disease rates between males and females?
- What is the age distribution for each sex, and how does it relate to heart disease?

## 4. Clinical Symptoms Analysis
- Which chest pain type (cp) is most associated with heart disease?
- Do asymptomatic patients (cp = 3) still show heart disease presence?
- What is the relationship between resting blood pressure (trestbps) and heart disease?
- How does cholesterol level (chol) correlate with heart disease presence?
- Does elevated fasting blood sugar (fbs = 1) increase heart disease risk?

## 5. Cardiac Test Results
- Which resting ECG pattern (restecg) is most predictive of heart disease?
- Is there a correlation between maximum heart rate (thalach) and heart disease? Do patients with disease have lower max heart rates?
- How does exercise-induced angina (exang) relate to heart disease diagnosis?
- What is the relationship between ST-depression (oldpeak) values and disease presence?
- Which ST segment slope (slope) pattern is most associated with heart disease?

## 6. Blood Disorder Analysis
- How does the number of major vessels (ca) correlate with heart disease severity?
- Which thalassemia classification (thal) shows the highest heart disease prevalence?
- Are there patients with NULL thalassemia values (thal = 0), and how should they be handled?

## 7. Multivariate Analysis
- What combinations of symptoms/tests are most predictive of heart disease?
- Are there interaction effects between age, sex, and chest pain type?
- How do multiple risk factors (high cholesterol + high blood pressure + diabetes) compound disease risk?

## 8. Feature Importance
- Which variables show the strongest correlation with the target variable?
- Are there redundant features that provide similar information?
- Which features could be most useful for predictive modeling?

## 9. Outlier & Data Quality
- Are there outliers in numeric variables (trestbps, chol, thalach, oldpeak)?
- Are there missing values or NULL entries that need handling?
- Do any values fall outside medically plausible ranges?

## 10. Comparative Analysis
- How do patients with vs. without exercise-induced angina differ across other variables?
- What are the characteristic profiles of patients with different chest pain types?
- How do cardiac test results differ between disease-positive and disease-negative groups?
